## Pets

Finish implementing the following pets before starting Pixlab:

<table class="sized">
  <tr>
    <td><code>Person</code></td>
    <td>A person can have pets. A person with pets is happy when all of her pets are happy. A person without pets is never happy.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>Snake</code></td>
    <td>A snake eats mice, but is happy only if the mice it eats are both more than a week old and weigh more than 0.4 oz.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>Parrot</code></td>
    <td>A parrot keeps track of the last 3 sentences it hears. When called, it randomly repeats one of those sentences. A parrot is happy if it has 3 sentences and they are all different.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>Turtle</code></td>
    <td>A turtle is happy if and only if its owner doesn't also own a cat. Turtles CANNOT go for a walk.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Pixlab

[Setup and Completion Instructions](../pixlab). Be sure to follow the 7 step process for completing the Exercises.

Do **Not** move past `Activity 3` yet. Work on [codingbat](http://codingbat.com) instead.

The activities use `Objects` and `2D arrays` extensively. If you need help, refer to these **ProgrammedLessons** sections:

<table class="borderless nolines sized inset">
  <tr>
    <td><code>Objects</code></td>
    <td><span class="arrow">▶</span></td>
    <td><a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/index.html#part06">Part 6: Object Oriented Programming</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>2D Arrays</code></td>
    <td><span class="arrow">▶</span></td>
    <td><a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap67/ch67_01.html">Chapter 67</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>
