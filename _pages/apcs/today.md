<!-- <div class="section" markdown="1">

[Java Chortle](https://chortle.ccsu.edu/cs151/cs151java.html) Exercises for Chapters 30-25

</div>

<!-- Complete `Activity 4` before class on Monday. Follow the [7 step process](../pixlab#process) for completing the Exercises.

Do **Not** move on to `Activity 5` yet. Work on [codingbat](http://codingbat.com) if you finish early.

### Review

The activity uses `Objects` and `2D arrays` extensively. If you need help with these concepts, refer to:

<table class="borderless nolines sized inset">
  <tr>
    <td><code>Objects</code></td>
    <td><span class="arrow">▶</span></td>
    <td>Part 6: Object Oriented Programming on <a href="https://chortle.ccsu.edu/cs151/cs151java.html">Chortle</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>2D Arrays</code></td>
    <td><span class="arrow">▶</span></td>
    <td><a href="https://chortle.ccsu.edu/Java5/Notes/chap49C/ch49C_1.html">Chapter 49C</a> on Chortle</td>
  </tr>
</table> -->
