<!--Continue working on the [Karel Levels](../karel).-->
Turn in your Space Invaders game using Google Drive by the end of the day.


<!--
### Space Invaders Modification Ideas

* Add a score (number of aliens destroyed)
* Spawn a new Alien when one is destroyed
* Aliens move down the screen
* Aliens move down the screen in a zig-zag pattern
* When an alien reaches the bottom the game is over
* Aliens fire lasers at the player
* Asteroids randomly fly down the screen, the player must avoid them
* Players have a limited number of bombs that clear the screen of Aliens briefly. Players earn bombs by killing a specific number of Aliens
