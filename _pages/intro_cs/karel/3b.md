  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A robot has been assigned to clean up a random hallway of beepers. The hallway can have several rooms on either side. Here's what the hallway might look like at the start:</p>

    <p>And here is another hallway the robot might see:</p>
    <img src="/public/img/karel/3b/start2.png">

    <p>Each time you run the program the hallway could change, so your solution has to be general enough to work for ALL hallways.</p>
    <p>Karel's job is to make the hallway clear of beepers, no matter where they are.</p>

    <p class="warning">The robot does not have to set down the beepers anywhere! Just clean them up.</p>
    <p class="caution">When you think you are done, run your solution several times to make sure it works for all hallways.</p>
