## User Story - Jamie


Jamie is interviewed about using Vistafy to listen to music. Jamie says, when I tap on a band's card I see a grid of albums for that band. I can tap on an album to see a list of the songs on that album, in order with play times. The songs also alternate between two different background colors to make it easier to read. When I select a song, the album takes up the whole screen (except the top and bottom sections) with player controls on top, including thumbs up/down buttons. This whole time, I could go back to previous screens by tapping an arrow that showed up in the top bar when I started selecting things.


Draw diagrams on paper of each screen in Jamie's story, then implement your ideas in html and css.
