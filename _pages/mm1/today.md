<p class="label left large">Filming</p>

### Scene List

One `Scene Outline` for each scene:

* Scene Name
* Expected filming location
* Actors needed
* Props needed
* Coverage needed
  * What different camera angles will we need when editing?
  * At least 3 for every scene
* Other details
  * Voice Over?
  * Sound Effects?
  * Music?


### Rehearse

Practice your lines and decide the setup of the scene before filming.

### Filming

You must get your completed scene outline approved by the substitute to film outside of the classroom.

Things to remember:

* Film in landscape.
* Try not to mix phones, each has a different camera that will give a different look
* Every scene needs to be filmed from at least 3 angles.
* Start recording, count down with fingers while saying "3, 2". Don't say one, but point or nod at the actors to start action. 
* Do not stop recording immediately when action is done, keep it on for a couple of seconds. This will allow for better transitions later.
* Multiple takes are important. Get the scene right, not just done.
