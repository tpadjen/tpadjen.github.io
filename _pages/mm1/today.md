* 3 Images 
  * The movie poster
  * A scene from the movie
  * A picture of the actor that played the main character
* A paragraph describing why it is worth seeing
* A list of the 3 most important characters
* A link to the [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/) page for the movie

<!-- Complete all Photoshop assignments by the end of the week:

* 5 blog posts
* Project 1 - Wish Week Posters
* Project 2 - Travel Advertisements
* Project 3 - Superhero Team

Put the exported pictures and your Photoshop files in appropriate folders on Google Drive to turn them in. 


### Project 1 - Wish Week Posters

You have been asked by the MV Leadership team to create a series of posters for Wish Week.

Each of the **3** posters you will contribute must:

* Be 2 ft x 3 ft in dimension (portrait) or 3 ft x 2 ft (landscape)
* Have a theme
* Have at least 3 pictures embedded your group has taken that represent something about wish week
* Include Photoshop techniques, including:
  * Text
  * Layer FX
  * Adjustment Layers
  * Filters
  * Masks
* Look interesting


### Project 2 - Travel Advertisement

You have been hired by Student Destinations, a travel company that sends groups of students around the world. They want you to create a new set of Facebook ads for them. Their concept: a series of pictures of one group of students enjoying multiple trips to exotic locales. The problem is, they are a brand new business and can't afford to hire a group and send them to all of these places yet. That's where your Photoshop magic comes in:

  * Take pictures of your group celebrating or being happy.
  * Find existing photos of interesting places where young people want to go.
  * Remove any people already in the photos (you must do this at least once).
  * Add yourselves to the photo, so it looks like you were really there.
  * Remove any branding on your clothing.
  * Add stylized text with the name of the destination, company, and a slogan for the company your group comes up with.
  * Add any other effects and/or processing to make the pictures look unique or appealing.


Each group member needs to contribute 2 destination pictures.

* Export your final pictures as high quality jpegs in two sizes, the original picture size and a thumbnail version no bigger than 200 px wide. Put them in a Week 2 - Destinations folder in your Photoshop folder of your Google Drive.


### Project 3 - Superhero Team

[Details here](../projects#photoshop) -->

<!--

<p class="label left large">Filming</p>

### Scene List

One `Scene Outline` for each scene:

* Scene Name
* Expected filming location
* Actors needed
* Props needed
* Coverage needed
  * What different camera angles will we need when editing?
  * At least 3 for every scene
* Other details
  * Voice Over?
  * Sound Effects?
  * Music?


### Rehearse

Practice your lines and decide the setup of the scene before filming.

### Filming

You must get your completed scene outline approved by the substitute to film outside of the classroom.

Things to remember:

* Film in landscape.
* Try not to mix phones, each has a different camera that will give a different look
* Every scene needs to be filmed from at least 3 angles.
* Start recording, count down with fingers while saying "3, 2". Don't say one, but point or nod at the actors to start action. 
* Do not stop recording immediately when action is done, keep it on for a couple of seconds. This will allow for better transitions later.
* Multiple takes are important. Get the scene right, not just done.
