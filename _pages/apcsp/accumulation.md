Without googling or using stack overflow, write and test the following functions in your iteration repository:

## alternating_sum

  given a list of integers, find the sum but substitute subtraction for every other addition

  Example: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5] becomes 1 + 3 - 2 + 4 - 5 = 1

## sum_outside

  given a list of integers and two numbers (min and max), find the sum of the numbers in the list that are not in the range [min, max)

  Example: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5], 2, 4 becomes 1 + 4 + 5 = 10

## count_close_remainders

  given a list of integers and a divisor, count how many numbers within 1 of being divisible by the divisor

  Example: [4, 11, 23, 14, 3, 40, 26, 17], 5 becomes 5 

## double_down

  given a list of integers and a target integer, return a version of the list with certain numbers doubled. Numbers should be doubled when they are smaller than the previous number or within 3 of the target

  Example: [1, 2, 1, 4, 2], 6 becomes [1, 2, 2, 8, 4]


## standard_deviation

  given a list of numbers, find the [standard deviation](http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation.html) of the list.
