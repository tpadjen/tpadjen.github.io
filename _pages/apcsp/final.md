### Transformation

Many computing problems can be summarized as transformations. Given some information (usually by a user), the code will transform or process that information based on a set of rules to provide some output. For example, each of these common situations can be analyzed as transformations:

* A woman searches Google for a "gift for Mom". Google receives the search and uses its algorithms to build and send back a list of related websites.
* A high school student writes an English paper. After every keystroke, the writing software compares every written word against a dictionary to catch any misspelled words. If an error is found, the word is highlighted.
* A Youtube star uploads a new HD video. Youtube processes the video, making several different versions so people with high quality and low quality internet connections or devices can enjoy it. Youtube also sends the video along to a company that automatically adds closed captioning.
* An artist adds a sepia filter to a photograph. The image processing app restricts the range of color information stored in the picture file to generate the effect.
* A video game enthusiast plays the new Mario game. The software translates the button presses and stick movements of the controller into character motion on screen. 
* The band needs to transpose a song to match the vocal range of its lead singer (sound familiar?).

### Assignment

Your job is to identify and solve a transformation problem using code. Your solution must:

* Be non-trivial (not so easy to solve that someone would never use it)
* Be interesting / unique
* Use each of these computing concepts:
  * variables
  * functions
  * lists
  * iteration
  * abstraction -> Read the answer to [this Stack Overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21220155/what-does-abstraction-mean-in-programming) for an explanation

You may use fake data (for example, from mockaroo) but your problem must real.
