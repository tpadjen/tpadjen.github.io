Implement the functions on the List Challenges handout.

<!-- <p class="label left large">To Be Done By Wednesday</p>

Write the following functions without using built in string functions or regexs:

### replace_letter
Replace all occurences of a given character in a string with a given replacement

<p class="label small">Usage</p>
```python
print replace_letter("banana", "a", "!")
```

<p class="label small">Output</p>
```shell
b!n!n!
```

<hr>

### switch_letters
Given a string and two letters to switch, swap each occurence of either letter in the string with the other one

<p class="label small">Usage</p>
```python
print switch_letters("textbook", "e", "o")
```

<p class="label small">Output</p>
```shell
toxtbeek
```

<hr>

### switch_words
same as switch_letters, but it works with words too

<p class="label small">Usage</p>
```python
switch_words("The brown fox jumps over the dog", "fox", "dog")
```

<p class="label small">Output</p>
```shell
The brown dog jumps over the fox
```

<hr>

### censor_text
Given a string, a list of inappropriate words, and a list of replacement words, replace every occurence of an inappropriate word in the string with a replacement word. Cycle through the replacement words, reusing them if necessary.
